\section{Conclusion}

The CNN performed extraordinarily well on the data.  Through cleaning and preprocessing, we were able to remove much of the noise, but not all.  Despite that, we were able to train a strong classifier.  The most surprising aspect of this project was how little machine learning there was compared to preprocessing and cleaning.  This project was a success and demonstrated how machine learning and data appear in the real-world.  In short, we did not make C-3PO, but we made a good gender handwriting recognizer!
