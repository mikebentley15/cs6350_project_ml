The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints does extensive work with digitizing census records into a digital format.  This is done manually and all over the world.
In 2015, 330 million records were manually indexed through the indexing program of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \cite{web:indexingStats}.
Today alone, 88,000 records were indexed by individuals all around the world \cite{web:indexingStats}.
There are millions of records today waiting to be indexed so that members and non-members alike can connect the dots in compiling their family history.
There is so much information stored in handwritten form that currently we rely on people to descipher what is written.

We decided to try our hand at using machine learning to automate indexing of historical documents.  In the general case, handwriting recognition is an extremely difficult as there can be wild variations in handwriting style, as well as corrections and mistakes.  To limit the scope of our project, we limited the task to recognizing a handwritten M or F in the gender field of an old census record.
