With the new movie release of Star Wars we thought about the genius of C-3PO.  This wonderous robot who was recognized as a God to little teddy bear creatures is fluent in over six million forms of communication.  For our project we wished to create a universal translator such as C-3PO however we were encourage to focus on creating a universal translator of a single handwritten letter "m" or "f"; which represents the gender of a indivudal in Alabama in 1836.
